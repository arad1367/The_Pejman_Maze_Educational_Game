- Practical applications of AI

## Technical Implementation

The game is built using Roblox Studio with Lua scripting. The main components include:

- **GameManager.lua**: Handles player data management, leaderboards, and game state
- **EmeraldHandler.lua**: Manages interactive emeralds that trigger AI quiz questions and power-ups
- **PlayerController.lua**: Controls player UI, inventory, and client-side interactions
- **DoorScript.lua**: Manages door behaviors for success/failure conditions
- **FallingStarsHandler.lua**: Controls the challenging falling star obstacles
- **BackgroundMusic.lua**: Manages game audio and atmosphere

The game leverages the Roblox platform's capabilities for:
- 3D environment rendering
- Multiplayer functionality
- Physics simulations
- Data persistence
- User interface components
- online chat and audio interactions
